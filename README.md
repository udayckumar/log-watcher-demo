### Log Watching Solution

### Implementations:

1. Create a server side program to monitor the given log file + capable of streaming updates which are happening in the file

Program + file - reside on the same server.

2. Host a web based client that will update in the file, as and when it happens, and doesn't need any page refresh to reflect the changes.

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.
